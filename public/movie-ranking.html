<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Forrest Gump</h3>
<p>Teaches you what life is all about, and anyone can live a wonderful life.</p>
<h3>Shawshank Redemption</h3>
<p>
  Another masterpiece on life and how life revolves around those who you spend
  your time with. You can survive and overcome the toughest of times with skills
  you've aciqured in your lifetime.

<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>
  Shows how a gift from God can be a boon to others but curse for the person
  having it, really makes you cry towards the end.
